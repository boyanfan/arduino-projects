# ArduinoProjects
arduino-projects is a collection of projects implemented in C++, demonstrating how to use Arduino to interact with various sensors and control components such as motors and LEDs. These projects serve as a resource for learning about embedded systems and IoT development.

## Features
- Sensor Integration: Read data from sensors like temperature, light, and motion sensors.
- Component Control: Use sensor data to control components like motors, LEDs, and more.
- Real-Time Data Processing: Process sensor data in real-time to trigger actions.
- Customizable Projects: Easily adapt projects for different hardware setups.
